[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/endjin-labs/Argotic/_apis/build/status/argotic-syndication-framework.Argotic?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/endjin-labs/Argotic/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)

The Argotic Syndication Framework was originally created by Brian Kuhn in 2007. Argotic is one of the most powerful and extensible web content syndication frameworks available to .NET developers, supporting RSS, ATOM, OPML, APML, RSD and BlogML. The project had become dormant, but has been brought back to life by [endjin](https://endjin.com), as Argotic is used to produce the [Azure Weekly Newsletter](https://azureweekly.info) and [Power BI Weekly Newsletter](https://powerbiweekly.info).

The project has been updated to .NET Standard 2.0. The source code is in the process of being cleaned up and updated to support the latest C# / .NET idioms. Updated NuGet packages will be published shortly.

See the [wiki](https://argotic-syndication-framework.github.io/Argotic) for detailed documentation.
