**Argotic: We speak the language so you don't have to.**

*ar·got·ic* (_ahr-got-ik_)
A specialized idiomatic vocabulary peculiar to a particular class or group of people.

Originally created by Brian Kuhn in 2007, Argotic is one of the most powerful and extensible web content syndication frameworks available to .NET developers.

The project had become dormant, but has been brought back to life by [endjin](https://endjin.com), as Argotic is used to produce the [Azure Weekly Newsletter](http://azureweekly.info).

The project has been updated to .NET Standard 2.0. The source code is in the process of being cleaned up and updated to support the latest C# / .NET idioms. Updated NuGet packages will be published shortly.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/endjin/Argotic/wiki) for detailed documentation.
